## 1. Overview

This project involves developing a cloud server on WordPress running on AWS through EC2. The application of this server is to demonstrate deployment, manual setup, and fundamental infrastructure abilities through Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

---

## 2. EC2 Instance Setup

- **Cloud Provider:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)  
- **Service Used:** EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

**Setup Details:**
- **Instance Type:** t2.micro (Free Tier)
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Key Pair Name:** ICT171ec2.pem
- **Region:** Asia Pacific (Sydney) ap-southeast-2
- **Public IPv4 Address:** [http://13.211.64.21](http://13.211.64.21)

## 3. Security Group Rules

A new security group was configured with the following inbound rules:

| Port | Protocol | Source      | Purpose        |
|------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| 22   | TCP      | 0.0.0.0/0   | SSH Access     |
| 80   | TCP      | 0.0.0.0/0   | HTTP Access    |
| 443  | TCP      | 0.0.0.0/0   | HTTPS Access   |

These rules ensure web traffic can reach the server and allow remote SSH configuration.

---

## 4. SSH Access

To securely access the EC2 instance, I used the following steps:

1. Adjusted file permissions on the PEM key:
   ```bash
   chmod 400 ICT171ec2.pem
2. Connected to the EC2 instance via SSH:
   ```bash
   ssh -i "ICT171ec2.pem" ubuntu@13.211.64.21
Once connected, I've got full terminal access to the instance.

## 5. PHP & MariaDB Installation

In preparation for WordPress, I installed PHP and MariaDB:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install nginx mariadb-server php-fpm php-mysql
   ```
Once configured, these packages will enable WordPress to run and interact with a backend database.

---

## 6. WordPress Installation and Permissions

### 6.1 Download and Extract WordPress
I downloaded the latest version of WordPress and extracted it:
```bash
sudo wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
sudo tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz
sudo rm latest.tar.gz
```
I then made sure the extraction worked using:
```bash
ls -la
```

### 6.2 Set Ownership and Permissions
I changed ownership to allow the web server to access WordPress files:
```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data wordpress/
```

I checked the file listing again:
```bash
ls -la
```

Set appropriate directory and file permissions:
```bash
sudo find wordpress/ -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
sudo find wordpress/ -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
```

Then I navigated into the WordPress directory:
```bash
cd wordpress/
ls -la
```

## 7. Securing MariaDB and Creating a Database

### 7.1 Secure Installation
For the secure installation, I did the following:
```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```
This is how I responded to the following prompts:

- **Set root password:** ```Y```
- **Remove anonymous users:** ```Y```
- **Disallow remote root login:** ```Y```
- **Remove test database:** ```Y```
- **Reload privilege tables:** ```Y```

### 7.2 Create Database and User
To get inside the MariaDB shell, I used:
```bash
sudo mysql -u root -p
```
Once inside the MariaDB shell, I used the following commands:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE ict171_db DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'zbict171_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'zb_pw';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ict171_db.* TO 'zbict171_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

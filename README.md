## 3. Security Group Rules

A new security group was configured with the following inbound rules:

| Port | Protocol | Source      | Purpose        |
|------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| 22   | TCP      | 0.0.0.0/0   | SSH Access     |
| 80   | TCP      | 0.0.0.0/0   | HTTP Access    |
| 443  | TCP      | 0.0.0.0/0   | HTTPS Access   |

These rules ensure web traffic can reach the server and allow remote SSH configuration.

## 4. SSH Access

To securely access the EC2 instance, I used the following steps:

1. Adjusted file permissions on the PEM key:
   ```bash
   chmod 400 ICT171ec2.pem
2. Connected to the EC2 instance via SSH:
   ```bash
   ssh -i "ICT171ec2.pem" ubuntu@13.211.64.21
Once connected, I've got full terminal access to the instance.

## 5. PHP & MariaDB Installation

1. In preparation for WordPress, I installed PHP and MariaDB:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install nginx mariadb-server php-fpm php-mysql
Once configured, these packages will enable WordPress to run and interact with a backend database.
